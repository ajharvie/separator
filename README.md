**An improved liquid-liquid separator based on an optically monitored porous capillary**

This repository contains arduino firmware and design files required to implement an automated liquid-liquid separator described in Reaction Chemistry & Engineering. 

The article can be found at: https://doi.org/10.1039/C9RE00144A

The video file Video_S1.mp4 shows the separator in operation.

Instructions on how to assemble, operate and troubleshoot problems with the described separator are in the supporting information, which can also be found at the above link.
